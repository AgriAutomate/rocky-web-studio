# Challenge 6: Labour Shortages & Rising Wage Costs

## Problem Sections

Central Queensland faces acute labour challenges including skills shortage (healthcare professionals, tradespeople, skilled manufacturing workers in short supply, businesses compete aggressively on wages to attract talent), wage inflation (minimum wage increases 5-6% annually, skilled worker demands 8-12% annually, many SMEs can't match wage growth without pricing customers out of market), retention challenges (younger workers leave for Brisbane for better career prospects and social opportunities, regional businesses lose investment in training), training costs (getting staff certified/skilled takes 6-12 months and often A$5,000-A$20,000 in costs, high turnover makes training ROI poor), and burnout (understaffed businesses work existing staff harder, creating burnout and turnover).

Reality: A small healthcare practice with 5 staff, A$800,000 revenue pays average wage A$50,000/staff = A$250,000 wage bill. With superannuation + payroll tax: A$290,000 total labour cost = 36% of revenue. If wages increase 6% annually: +A$17,400/year. But if revenue only grows 3%, that's net margin compression.

Cost inflation squeeze includes wage increases not matched by revenue growth causing margin compression. Service quality risk includes understaffing leading to poor service, burnout, and customer complaints. Growth limitation includes inability to hire staff to support growth without massive wage costs. Operational fragility includes loss of key staff that can cripple small business.

Rocky Web Studio addresses this through labour automation & productivity enhancement (data entry automation eliminating manual work freeing staff for higher-value work saving 5-10 hours/week per staff member, scheduling & routing optimization reducing admin time by 80%, customer service automation with chatbots handling 40-60% of routine inquiries, document automation auto-generating forms/proposals/contracts, reporting automation auto-generating monthly reports and dashboards), staff productivity & upskilling systems (performance dashboard with real-time visibility, training management tracking certifications and renewals, knowledge base reducing repetitive training, time tracking analyzing where staff time goes), remote work & contractor integration (digital workflows enabling remote work, contractor management automating onboarding and payment, geographic reach hiring specialized talent from outside Central Queensland without relocation costs), and workforce planning & capacity modeling (demand forecasting predicting busy seasons, scenario planning for growth, labour cost modeling understanding cost of hiring vs. automation vs. outsourcing). Example: Healthcare practice with 2 admin staff can reduce to 1.2 FTE + automation system handling 20% more customer volume at 24% cheaper than hiring another staff member.
