# Challenge 2: Cash Flow Strain & Declining Profitability

## Problem Sections

SMEs face persistent cash flow challenges from multiple sources: slow customer payments (businesses paying invoices after 60+ days while needing to pay suppliers within 30 days), seasonal revenue fluctuations (healthcare quiet in December, agriculture peak after harvest, tourism seasonal), inventory holding costs (especially critical in retail, manufacturing, and distribution), high customer concentration risk (30-40% of revenue from 2-3 major customers creates vulnerability), and declining margins (even with sales growth, profitability declining due to cost inflation and competitive pricing pressure).

Typical scenario: A healthcare services provider invoices patients/insurance companies for A$10,000/month. But only 70% pay within 30 days (A$7,000), 20% pay at 60 days (A$2,000), and 10% default. Meanwhile, they must pay staff every 2 weeks and rent monthly. Result: constant cash flow crisis despite profitable operations on paper.

Cash flow problems force business owners to skip growth investments, reduce staff (losing productivity and customer service quality), accept unfavorable payment terms with suppliers (higher costs), constantly stress about meeting payroll and rent, and miss opportunities to expand. This is especially acute in regional Queensland where government customers take 20-30 days minimum to pay, agricultural sector has extreme seasonal peaks and troughs, and mining services have long payment cycles tied to project stages.

Rocky Web Studio addresses this through billing & cash collection acceleration (automated invoicing same-day after service delivery, online payment portal with reminders, automated payment reminders at day 7/14/20, early payment discounts automating 2% discount for payment within 10 days), expense management & working capital optimization (vendor payment automation, inventory management with real-time tracking, cash flow forecasting with 13-week rolling forecast), business intelligence for profitability (customer profitability analysis, product/service margin analysis, seasonal forecasting), and micro-lending integration (government grant coordination, alternative financing options like invoice financing and merchant cash advances).
