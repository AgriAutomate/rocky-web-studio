## Identified Gaps & Development Plan

### Gap 1: External Client Case Studies
**Current State:** Only internal case studies (Rocky Web Studio projects)
**Impact:** Government tenders often require external client references
**Priority:** HIGH
**Timeline:** 3-6 months

**Action Plan:**
1. **Immediate (Month 1-2):**
   - Complete 1-2 small client projects ($5K-$10K range)
   - Focus on accessibility or AI integration projects
   - Document thoroughly with before/after metrics
   - Get client testimonials and permission to use as case study

2. **Short-term (Month 3-4):**
   - Target 1 government-adjacent client (NFP, university, local council)
   - Deliver WCAG 2.1 AA compliant website
   - Document compliance process and results
   - Get written permission for case study use

3. **Medium-term (Month 5-6):**
   - Build portfolio of 3-5 external client case studies
   - Mix of website builds, accessibility audits, AI solutions
   - Include testimonials, metrics, and outcomes

**Success Metrics:**
- 3-5 external client case studies
- At least 1 government-adjacent client
- Written testimonials from all clients
- Permission to use in tender submissions

---

### Gap 2: Multi-Language Support Capability
**Current State:** Mentioned as capability but not proven
**Impact:** Some government contracts require multi-language support
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Timeline:** 2-3 months

**Action Plan:**
1. **Month 1:**
   - Research Next.js i18n (internationalization) solutions
   - Build proof-of-concept with 2 languages (English + one other)
   - Document implementation approach

2. **Month 2:**
   - Implement multi-language support on Rocky Web Studio site
   - Add language switcher component
   - Test with screen readers and accessibility tools

3. **Month 3:**
   - Offer multi-language as optional feature to next client
   - Document process and outcomes
   - Add to capability statement

**Success Metrics:**
- Working multi-language implementation
- Documentation of process
- At least 1 client project with multi-language support

---

### Gap 3: Advanced Security Certifications
**Current State:** OWASP-aligned practices, but no formal certifications
**Impact:** Some contracts require ISO 27001, SOC 2, or similar
**Priority:** LOW-MEDIUM (depends on contract requirements)
**Timeline:** 6-12 months (if pursuing formal certification)

**Action Plan:**
1. **Short-term (Month 1-3):**
   - Document all security practices in detail
   - Create security policy documents
   - Align with ISO 27001 controls (without certification)
   - Can claim "ISO 27001-aligned" practices

2. **Medium-term (Month 4-6):**
   - Consider ISO 27001 certification if contracts require it
   - Evaluate cost vs. benefit
   - May not be necessary for $20K-$80K contracts

3. **Alternative Approach:**
   - Partner with hosting provider (Vercel) that has certifications
   - Leverage their SOC 2, ISO 27001 certifications
   - Document how we use certified infrastructure

**Success Metrics:**
- Comprehensive security documentation
- ISO 27001-aligned practices documented
- Decision on formal certification (if needed)

### Risk: Over-Investing in Unnecessary Capabilities
**Mitigation:** Evaluate each capability against actual contract requirements

### Risk: Not Having External Case Studies
**Mitigation:** Prioritize getting 1-2 external clients immediately

### Risk: Missing Contract Opportunities
**Mitigation:** Focus on quick wins first, then build out capabilities based on demand
