# Challenge 5: Cybersecurity Threats

## Problem Sections

SMEs are increasingly targets for cyberattacks despite believing "we're too small to be hacked." Reality includes ransomware (criminals encrypt business data and demand payment, average ransom A$50,000-A$300,000, average recovery cost A$150,000-A$500,000), data breaches (customer data stolen and sold on dark web, compliance fines A$50,000-A$500,000 under Privacy Act, reputational damage can shut down small businesses), email compromise (hacker accesses business email, sends fraudulent invoices, moves money out of bank accounts, average loss A$5,000-A$50,000 per incident), credential theft (staff passwords stolen via phishing or data breaches, hackers access systems and steal customer information), and malware/virus (systems become slow, data corrupted, customer-facing websites defaced).

Statistics: 43% of cyberattacks target SMEs. Average cost of breach for SMEs: A$200,000 in direct costs + A$100,000+ in indirect costs (downtime, customer churn, staff distractions).

Financial risk includes ransomware and data breaches that can bankrupt small businesses. Regulatory risk includes Privacy Act breaches triggering mandatory reporting and fines. Reputational risk includes customer trust destroyed if their data is compromised. Operational risk includes ransomware or system failures meaning business can't operate. Insurance gaps include most standard business insurance not covering cyber incidents, with cyber insurance being expensive and having high deductibles.

Rocky Web Studio addresses this through foundational security by default (secure hosting on AWS with encryption at rest and in transit, daily automated backups stored in separate AWS account ransomware-proof, all sensitive data encrypted using AES-256, secure development following OWASP standards), multi-layer security implementation (multi-factor authentication requiring password + phone verification, role-based access control limiting staff to relevant data, activity logging flagging suspicious activity automatically, network security with firewalls and intrusion detection), security monitoring & incident response (24/7 automated alerts for suspicious activity, pre-defined incident response procedures, annual penetration testing and security assessment, audit-ready compliance documentation), staff cybersecurity training (phishing awareness teaching staff to identify phishing emails, password management enforcing strong passwords, social engineering defense training, privacy best practices for handling sensitive data), and cyber insurance support (maintaining audit trails and documentation insurers require, helping document incidents for insurance claims, providing proof of security controls for insurance underwriting). RWS messaging: "Cybersecurity isn't an IT cost—it's a business risk management investment. For a few thousand dollars in security setup, we prevent A$200,000+ potential breach costs."
