## Section 2: Clarification (5-15 minutes)

### Targeted Clarifying Questions

**Select 3-5 questions based on their form answers. Mix of these:**

#### Question 1: Pain Point Deep Dive

**If they mentioned a specific problem:**
> "You mentioned [problem from form]. Can you tell me more about how that's impacting your business right now? What does a typical day look like when dealing with this?"

**If they mentioned low sales:**
> "You mentioned wanting to increase sales. What's your current process for generating leads? Where do most of your customers come from right now?"

**If they mentioned time constraints:**
> "You mentioned being short on time. What tasks are taking up most of your time that you wish could be automated?"

**Listen for:** Specific pain points, frequency of issues, current workarounds, cost of problem

#### Question 2: Current Solution Assessment

**Script:**
> "What are you currently using to [address their main need]? How well is that working for you?"

**Follow-up based on answer:**
- **If they have a solution:** "What's missing from your current setup? What would make it perfect?"
- **If they don't have a solution:** "What's been stopping you from implementing something? Budget, time, or not knowing where to start?"

**Listen for:** Current tools, frustrations, gaps, what they like/dislike

> "You mentioned measuring success by [metric from form]. How are you tracking that currently? What would success look like in 3 months? 6 months?"

**Listen for:** Current tracking methods, realistic expectations, business impact

#### Question 4: Timeline & Urgency

**Script:**
> "You mentioned wanting to launch by [date from form]. What's driving that timeline? Is there a specific event or deadline?"

**Follow-up:**
> "If we couldn't meet that exact date, what would be the impact? Is there flexibility, or is it critical?"

**Listen for:** Hard deadlines, flexibility, consequences of delay

**Script:**
> "Who else is involved in making this decision? What's their process typically like for projects like this?"

### Explore AI Automation Opportunities

**Based on their form answers, introduce AI opportunities:**

#### If They Mentioned Contact Forms

**Script:**
> "I noticed you need contact forms. That's great - we can definitely set that up. But I'm curious: how many inquiries do you get per week? And how much time do you spend responding to the same questions?"

**Wait for answer, then:**

> "Here's what I'm thinking: Instead of just a contact form, what if we added an AI chatbot that could answer common questions 24/7? It would be trained on your business information, so it knows your services, pricing, hours - everything. That way, you only get contacted for things that actually need your attention. Would that save you time?"

**Listen for:** Interest level, specific use cases, concerns about AI

#### If They Mentioned Booking System

**Script:**
> "You mentioned needing a booking system. That's perfect - we've built several of those. But let me ask: Do you find yourself manually confirming appointments or sending reminders?"

**Wait for answer, then:**

> "What if we automated that entire flow? When someone books, they get an instant confirmation. 24 hours before, they get a reminder. If they need to reschedule, they can do it themselves. And if they don't show up, we can automatically follow up. Would automated scheduling like that help?"

**Listen for:** Current manual processes, pain points, interest in automation

#### If They Mentioned FAQs or Content

**Script:**
> "I see you have [X] FAQs or content areas. How often do customers ask questions that are already answered on your site?"

**Wait for answer, then:**

> "Here's an idea: What if we created an AI chatbot that's trained on all your content - your FAQs, your service descriptions, your blog posts? Customers could ask questions in natural language, and the AI would pull the right information instantly. It's like having a team member who knows everything about your business and never sleeps. Does that sound useful?"

**Listen for:** Volume of repetitive questions, interest in AI assistance

#### If They Selected AI Features in Form

**Script:**
> "I noticed you're interested in AI features. That's exciting! What specific problems are you hoping AI could solve for you?"

**Wait for answer, then:**

> "Based on what you've told me, I think [specific AI solution] could really help with [their problem]. Here's how it would work..."

**Listen for:** Specific use cases, concerns, budget for AI features

### Listen for Unmentioned Pain Points

**Probe for hidden needs:**

**Script:**
> "Is there anything else that's been frustrating you that we haven't talked about yet? Sometimes the biggest wins come from solving problems people didn't even know could be solved."

**Listen for:** Additional pain points, "nice to have" items, future needs

**Note-taking points for this section:**
- [ ] Specific pain points mentioned
- [ ] Current solutions and gaps
- [ ] Success metrics and tracking
- [ ] Timeline constraints
- [ ] Decision-makers and process

>

> - **Week 4-6:** Development - we build everything out
> - **Week 7:** Testing and refinements - we make sure everything works perfectly

> 
> For your project, given [their specific needs], I'd estimate [X] weeks. Does that timeline work for you?"

**Listen for:** Timeline concerns, urgency, flexibility

### Recommend 3 Package Options

**Based on their budget and needs, present 3 options:**

#### Package 1: Basic (Starting at $X)

**Script:**

**Listen for:** Interest level, budget fit, feature concerns

**Listen for:** Budget fit, value perception, interest in premium features

**After presenting all three:**

**Script:**
> "Which of these feels like the best fit for your needs and budget? Or do you have questions about any of them?"

**Listen for:** Preference, concerns, budget questions

### Show Relevant Case Studies

**Select 1-2 case studies based on their industry/needs:**

**Script:**
> "Let me show you a project we did that's similar to yours. [Company Name] came to us with [similar problem]. Here's what we built for them..."

**Structure case study:**
1. **The Challenge:** Similar to their problem

3. **The Results:** Quantifiable outcomes
4. **Why It Matters:** Relevance to their situation

**Example:**
> "We worked with [Similar Company] in [their industry]. They had the same challenge you mentioned - [their problem]. We built them [solution] with [AI feature]. Within 3 months, they saw [result - e.g., 'a 40% reduction in manual inquiries' or 'a 25% increase in bookings']. 
> 
> The key was [specific feature/solution]. Does that sound like something that would help you?"

**Listen for:** Interest, questions, concerns, "that's exactly what I need" signals

**Listen for:** Process concerns, communication preferences, timeline questions

### Address Specific Concerns

**Based on what they've shared, proactively address concerns:**

#### If They Mentioned Budget Concerns

**Script:**
> "I know budget is always a consideration. Let me address that head-on: Our packages are designed to give you maximum value. The [Package Name] at [$X] includes [key features] that will [specific benefit].
> 
> But here's what I want you to know: We can work within your budget. If [$X] feels high, we can adjust the scope. We can start with the essentials and add features later. Or we can break it into phases. What's most important is that you get value that makes sense for your business. What budget range were you thinking?"

**Listen for:** Actual budget, flexibility, payment options interest

#### If They Mentioned Timeline Concerns

**Script:**
> "You mentioned needing this by [date]. I want to be honest: Our typical timeline is [X] weeks, but we can accelerate if needed. Here's what that would look like:
> 
> - We can start immediately after contract and deposit
> - We can prioritize your project
> - We can work in parallel phases where possible
> 
> The trade-off is [potential impact - e.g., 'fewer revision rounds' or 'slightly higher cost']. But if [date] is critical, we can make it work. How flexible is that date?"

**Listen for:** Actual deadline, flexibility, rush fee acceptance

#### If They Mentioned Feature Concerns

**Script:**
> "You mentioned needing [specific feature]. I want to make sure we address that. Here's how we'd handle it:

> - Your main goals are [Goal 1] and [Goal 2]
> - You need [Key Feature 1] and [Key Feature 2]
> - The [Package Name] at [$X] seems like the best fit
> - Timeline would be [X] weeks, launching around [date]
> 
> Does that sound right?"

**Wait for confirmation, then:**

> "Perfect! If you want to move forward, here's exactly what happens next:
> 
> **Step 1:** I'll send you a contract and proposal via email within the next hour. It will include everything we discussed - the scope, timeline, pricing, and next steps.
> 
> **Step 2:** You review the contract. If you have any questions or want to adjust anything, we can discuss. Once you're ready, you sign it and send back.
> 
> **Step 3:** You make the initial deposit - that's [X]% of the total project cost. This secures your spot in our schedule.
> 
> **Step 4:** We schedule your design kickoff meeting. That's usually within [X] days of receiving the deposit. During that call, we'll dive deep into your brand, preferences, and start the design process.
> 
> **Step 5:** We begin! You'll start seeing progress updates regularly, and we'll keep you in the loop every step of the way.
> 
> Does that process sound good? Any questions about what happens next?"

**Listen for:** Process questions, concerns, buying signals

### Send Contract Immediately

**Script:**
> "Great! I'm going to send you the contract right now while we're on the call. You should see it in your inbox in the next few minutes. It will come from [email address]."

**Send contract via email during call**

> "Did you receive it? Great! Take your time reviewing it. If you have any questions, just reply to that email or give me a call. I'm here to help."

**Listen for:** Email confirmation, immediate questions

### Schedule Design Kickoff (If Yes)

**If they say yes or show strong interest:**

**Script:**
> "Excellent! I'm excited to work with you. While you review the contract, let's go ahead and get your design kickoff on the calendar. That way, once you sign and send the deposit, we can hit the ground running.
> 
> What does your schedule look like next week? I have availability on [Day 1] at [Time 1] or [Day 2] at [Time 2]. What works better for you?"

**Schedule the kickoff call**

> "Perfect! I've got you scheduled for [Date] at [Time]. You'll receive a calendar invite shortly. Once you sign the contract and send the deposit, we'll confirm that kickoff date and you'll be all set!"

**Listen for:** Availability, scheduling preferences

### Schedule Follow-Up (If They Need to Think)

**Script:**
> "I completely understand - this is an important decision, and you want to make sure it's the right fit. That's smart.
> 
> Here's what I'd suggest: Take a few days to review the contract and think it over. I'll follow up with you on [Day] to see if you have any questions. Does that work?"

**Wait for response, then:**

> "Perfect! And remember - if you have any questions in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out. My email is [email] and my phone is [phone]. I'm here to help.

---

## Section 5: Contingencies & Objection Handling

### Contingency 1: Budget Lower Than Discussed

**If they say budget is lower:**

**Script:**
> "I understand - budget is always a consideration. Let me ask: What budget range were you thinking? Because we can absolutely work within that."

**Wait for answer, then:**

> "Here's what I'd suggest: We can reduce the scope to fit your budget. For example:
> 
> - We can start with the [Package Name] essentials
> - We can remove [non-critical feature] and add it later
> - We can break it into phases - Phase 1 gets you [core features], Phase 2 adds [additional features]
> 
> The key is getting you started with what you need most, then we can add more as your business grows. Does that approach work?"

**Alternative if still too high:**

> "I hear you. Let me be honest: For [$X], we can do [reduced scope]. But here's what I'd recommend: Instead of cutting features, what if we extended the timeline? That way you get everything you need, just over a longer period. Or we could start with [minimal viable product] and add features monthly. What do you think?"

**Listen for:** Actual budget, scope flexibility, payment plan interest

**Note:** Offer payment plans if appropriate

### Contingency 2: They Want Something Custom/Rare

**If they request unusual feature:**

**Script:**
> "That's an interesting requirement! Let me think about this... [Feature] isn't something we typically build, but I can see how it would help you.

Here's my recommendation: Let's scope that for a future phase. Here's why:
> 
> - It would add [X] weeks and [$Y] to the timeline
> - We want to make sure the core features work perfectly first
> - Once we see how you use the site, we can design [custom feature] to fit your actual workflow
> 
> Does that make sense? We can absolutely do it - I just want to make sure we do it right. And starting with the core features gets you launched faster."

**If they insist:**

> "I understand it's important to you. Here's what we can do: We can include it in Phase 1, but it will add [time/cost]. Or we can build a simpler version now and enhance it in Phase 2. Which approach do you prefer?"

**Listen for:** Flexibility, priority level, willingness to pay extra

### Contingency 3: Comparing with Other Agencies

**If they mention competitors:**

**Script:**
> "That's smart - you should compare options! I'm confident we're the right fit, but let me help you make an informed decision.

Here's what sets us apart:
> 
> - **AI-First Approach:** We don't just build websites - we build intelligent systems that save you time every day
> - **Industry Experience:** We've worked with [X] companies in [their industry], so we know the specific challenges
> - **Ongoing Support:** We don't disappear after launch - we're here for the long term
> - **Transparent Process:** You'll know exactly what's happening every step of the way
> 
> But here's what I'd suggest: Ask other agencies these questions:
> - How do they handle AI automation?
> - What's their post-launch support like?
> - Can they show you case studies in your industry?
> - What's included in their pricing?
> 
> Compare apples to apples. I think you'll find we offer more value. But I want you to feel confident in your decision, whatever it is."

**If they ask about pricing comparison:**

> "I can't speak to other agencies' pricing, but I can tell you what's included in ours: [List key inclusions]. Make sure you're comparing the same scope. Sometimes what looks cheaper actually costs more when you add everything you need."

**Listen for:** Specific competitor concerns, what they value most, decision factors

### Contingency 4: They're Hesitant

**If they seem uncertain:**

**Script:**
> "I can sense you might have some concerns. That's totally normal - this is a big decision. What's on your mind? What would make you feel more confident about moving forward?"

**Wait for their concern, then address it:**

**If they're worried about quality:**
> "I understand wanting to make sure you get quality work. Here's what I can offer:
> - We can start with a smaller project to prove ourselves
> - You'll see progress throughout - not just at the end
> - We have a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied
> - You can talk to our past clients - I'll give you references"

**If they're worried about timeline:**
> "I hear you on the timeline. Here's what I can commit to:
> - We'll put it in writing in the contract
> - You'll get weekly updates so you always know where we are
> - If we're going to be late, you'll know immediately - no surprises
> - We can include a penalty clause if that makes you feel better"

**If they're worried about cost:**
> "I understand budget concerns. Here's what I can do:
> - We can break it into phases so you're not paying everything upfront
> - We can start smaller and add features as you grow
> - We offer payment plans - we can work out a schedule that fits your cash flow
> - Remember: This is an investment that pays for itself through [specific benefit]"

**If they're just not ready:**
> "I completely understand - sometimes timing isn't right. Here's what I'd suggest:
> - Let's stay in touch - I'll check in with you in [X] months
> - In the meantime, I can send you some resources that might help
> - When you're ready, we'll be here
> - And I'll honor today's pricing for [X] months"

**Listen for:** Specific concerns, what would help them decide, buying signals

### Contingency 5: They Want to "Think About It"

**Script:**
> "Absolutely - I want you to feel 100% confident in your decision. Take the time you need.

But let me ask: What specifically do you need to think about? Is it the budget, the timeline, the features, or something else? Because I might be able to help clarify right now."

**Wait for answer, then address:**

**If it's budget:**
> "I understand. Here's what I can do: I'll hold today's pricing for [X] days. That gives you time to think it over without worrying about price increases. And if you have budget questions, I'm happy to discuss payment plans or scope adjustments."

**If it's features:**
> "I get it - you want to make sure we're building the right thing. Here's what I can do: I'll send you a detailed scope document that outlines exactly what we'll build. You can review it and see if anything is missing. And we can always adjust before we start."

**If it's timing:**
> "I understand - timing is important. Here's what I can do: I'll check our availability for [their preferred timeline]. If we can make it work, great. If not, we can discuss alternatives. But let's make sure timing isn't the only thing holding you back."

**Then:**

> "Here's my suggestion: Let's schedule a quick follow-up call for [Day]. That gives you time to think, but we can reconnect and answer any questions. Does that work?"

**Listen for:** Specific concerns, follow-up preferences, what would help
