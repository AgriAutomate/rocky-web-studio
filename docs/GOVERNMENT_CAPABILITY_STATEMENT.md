## PAGE 2: WHAT WE DELIVER

Rocky Web Studio provides four core service areas designed to meet government and enterprise requirements:

### Web Design & Development
We build responsive, content-managed websites (5–15 pages) optimised for performance and search visibility. Every site includes a modern CMS for content updates, mobile-first responsive design, and SEO foundations. Our sites load fast, rank well, and work seamlessly across all devices.

### Accessibility & Compliance
We ensure all websites meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards through automated and manual testing. Our compliance approach covers the Australian Privacy Act 1988, GDPR requirements, and accessibility legislation. We provide accessibility audit reports and remediation documentation for tender submissions.

### Lead Capture & CRM Integration
We implement secure contact forms, admin dashboards, and role-based access controls. Our lead capture systems integrate with popular CRM platforms and include automated notifications, data export capabilities, and privacy-compliant data handling.

### Government & Enterprise Support
We offer service level agreements (SLAs) with defined response times, business continuity planning, and dedicated support channels. Our team provides tender documentation support, technical specifications, and post-launch training to ensure smooth handover.

*Design this as: Four-column layout or two-by-two grid with icons/illustrations for each service area. Use clear headings and concise bullet points. Include visual hierarchy to guide the eye.*

## PAGE 3: TECHNICAL FOUNDATION

Rocky Web Studio builds on modern, enterprise-grade technology stacks proven in production environments.

### Build Stack
We use **Next.js 15** (React framework), **TypeScript** for type-safe development, **Vercel** for enterprise hosting, and **PostgreSQL** databases. This stack delivers fast page loads, scalable architecture, and reliable uptime. All code follows industry best practices and is production-ready from day one.

### Security
We implement **HTTPS/TLS encryption**, automated security updates, rate limiting, and protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Our security practices align with Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) guidelines. We conduct security audits and provide documentation for compliance reviews.

### Accessibility Testing
We combine **automated testing** (axe-core, WAVE) with **manual testing** (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility). Every site is tested with NVDA and JAWS screen readers, validated against WCAG 2.1 AA criteria, and includes accessibility statements for public-facing sites.

*Design this as: Three-column layout with icons for each section. Use technical but accessible language. Include visual elements like code snippets or architecture diagrams if space allows.*

### Team Structure
