## 🚀 QUICK START (Next 3 Steps)
### Step 1: TODAY (Dec 25)
```bash
# Read these in order:
1. This README.md (5 min)
2. EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md (15 min) - Big picture
3. QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md (10 min) - Keep visible
```

### Step 2: TOMORROW (Dec 26)
```bash
# Install tools:
1. Cursor IDE - https://cursor.com
2. Node.js + npm (if not already installed)
3. Git

# Setup project:
1. Clone rockywebstudio.com.au repo (or create new Next.js project)
2. Create .cursor/rules directory
3. Copy .cursorrules file from cursor_configuration_templates.md
4. Copy .cursor/rules/*.mdc files from cursor_configuration_templates.md
5. Run: npx sanity init (for CMS)

# Run baseline audit:
npm install axe-core pa11y lighthouse
npx axe rockywebstudio.com.au
→ Save results to reports/accessibility-baseline.md
```

### Step 3: START WEEK 1 (Dec 27)
```bash
# Follow Week 1 plan from implementation_plan_detailed.md
- Days 1-2: Complete automated accessibility audit
- Days 3-4: Manual screen reader testing with NVDA
- Days 5-7: Fix critical accessibility violations

# Use Cursor for every code change:
- Select code → Right-click → Cursor
- Copy prompts from implementation_plan_detailed.md
- Review diff before accepting changes
- Commit with descriptive messages
```

## 📊 WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING
### Project 1: WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Compliance
Timeline: Week 1-2 (14 days)
Effort: 20-25 hours
Deliverable: Professional case study + compliant website

```
Before: 6 axe violations, Lighthouse 72/100, NVDA issues
After:  0 violations, Lighthouse 98/100, 100% NVDA compatible
Result: Case study demonstrating WCAG expertise for government clients
```

### Project 2: AI Chatbot Implementation
Timeline: Week 2-3 (21 days)
Effort: 25-30 hours
Deliverable: Live chatbot + case study

```
Before: Manual inquiry handling = 2-4 hours/day, 9am-5pm only
After:  AI chatbot = 65% self-serve, 24/7, saves 2.5 hrs/day
Result: Case study demonstrating AI integration expertise
```

### Project 3: Headless CMS Implementation
Timeline: Week 3-4 (28 days)
Effort: 30-35 hours
Deliverable: CMS infrastructure + case study

```
Before: Content updates = 2-4 hours per page, requires developer
After:  10-15 minutes per update, non-technical staff can publish
Result: Case study demonstrating enterprise CMS expertise
```
