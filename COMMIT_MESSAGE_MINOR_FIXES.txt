- Fix hero section text contrast (increase opacity from 70-80% to 95%)
- Add aria-label to Xero connection status refresh button
- Add aria-label to invoice line item remove button

Accessibility improvements:

- Addresses Lighthouse issue: "Buttons do not have an accessible name" (icon buttons)
- Expected Lighthouse score improvement: 91/100 → 95-98/100

Files modified:
- components/hero-section.tsx - Hero text contrast improvements
- components/admin/XeroConnectionStatus.tsx - Refresh button aria-label
- components/admin/CreateInvoiceDialog.tsx - Remove button aria-label

Documentation:
