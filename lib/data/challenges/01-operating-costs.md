# Challenge 1: High Operating Costs & Inflation

## Problem Sections

Rising energy, supply chain, and wage costs are creating severe margin pressure for Central Queensland SMEs. Businesses that operated profitably at 20% margins are now struggling with 8-12% margins or thin/negative profitability.

This is particularly acute for Hospitality & Retail (energy costs up 30-45% in past 24 months, food and beverage COGS up 15-25%, labour increases 8-12% annually), Manufacturing & Distribution (fuel surcharges, electricity for production facilities, raw material costs), and Healthcare & Professional Services (rent, utilities, staff wages especially difficult in regional areas).

Businesses must either raise prices (risking customer loss), cut costs (impacting quality/service), or reduce profits. Most choose a combination—leading to operational stress. Businesses facing cost inflation are actively seeking ways to improve operational efficiency, reduce labour-intensive manual processes, minimize administrative overhead, improve cash flow visibility and forecasting, and automate repetitive tasks.

Rocky Web Studio addresses this through automation & process optimization (workflow automation saving 8-15 hours/week = A$15,000-A$30,000 annual labour cost reduction), operational efficiency systems (cost visibility dashboards, predictive analytics, supplier integration), revenue optimization (dynamic pricing, customer profitability analysis, upsell & cross-sell automation), and working capital improvement (faster invoicing & payment collection reducing DSO by 10-20 days, automated reminders & collections, expense forecasting).
